/*

Abstraction: Rather than listing out each individual step, we can group 
together commands so it can preform a single action as an function. This
makes the code easier to understand, and organzied.

Encapsulation: Controlling access and scope of various parts of your code.
This can be done through properties, brackets, or accessors. Not only does 
this help organize our code, but it also prevents us from accidentaly 
modifying variables.

Inheritance: When an object gains the methods and properties of it's parent. 

Polymorphism:
